 My name is **Vladislav Zhgirov** and I student RS School. Let’s get started.
`(Slide - Who I am)`
First of all, let’s talk about WWW. 
`(Slide - WWW)`
Where the WWW was born
`(Slide - Subtopic name)`
The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he working

at CERN
`(Slide - place of creation WWW)`
The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of computers, data networks and hypertext into a powerful and easy to use global information system.

 How the Web began
 `(Slide - Subtopic name)`
Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web in March 1989 and his second proposal in May 1990. Together with Belgian systems engineer Robert Cailliau, this was formalised as a management proposal in November 1990. This outlined the principal concepts and it defined important terms behind the Web. The document described a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by “browsers”. 
`(Slide - First page of Tim Berners-Lee's proposal)`
By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had the first Web server and browser up and running at CERN, demonstrating his ideas. He developed the code for his Web server on a NeXT computer. To prevent it being accidentally switched off, the computer had a hand-written label in red ink: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"
`(Slide - withreplica of the NeXT machine)`
info.cern.ch was the address of the world's first website and Web server, running on a NeXT computer at CERN. The first Web page address was this link (http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
