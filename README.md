Today I will tell about the history of the emergence of WWW, HTML, CSS.  
`(Slide - Topic Title)`  
My name is **Vladislav Zhgirov** and I student RS School. Let’s get started.  
`(Slide - Who I am)`  
First of all, let’s talk about WWW.   
`(Slide - WWW)`  
Where the WWW was born  
`(Slide - Subtopic name)`  
The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while he working   
`(Slide - creator WWW)`   
at CERN  
`(Slide - place of creation WWW)`  
The basic idea of the WWW was to merge the evolving technologies of computers, data networks and hypertext into a powerful and easy to use global information system.  
`(Slide - basic idea of WWW)`  
 How the Web began  
 `(Slide - Subtopic name)`  
Tim Berners-Lee wrote the first proposal for the World Wide Web in March 1989 and his second proposal in May 1990. Together with Belgian systems engineer Robert Cailliau, this was formalised as a management proposal in November 1990. This outlined the principal concepts and it defined important terms behind the Web. The document described a "hypertext project" called "WorldWideWeb" in which a "web" of "hypertext documents" could be viewed by “browsers”.     
`(Slide - First page of Tim Berners-Lee's proposal)`  
By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had the first Web server and browser up and running at CERN, demonstrating his ideas. He developed the code for his Web server on a NeXT computer. To prevent it being accidentally switched off, the computer had a hand-written label in red ink: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!"  
`(Slide - with replica of the NeXT machine)`  
info.cern.ch was the address of the world's first website and Web server, running on a NeXT computer at CERN. The first Web page address was this link (http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). This page contained links to information about the WWW project itself, including a description of hypertext, technical details for creating a Web server, and links to other Web servers as they became available.  
`(Slide - first web page and address)`  
The WWW design allowed easy access to existing information and an early web page linked to information useful to CERN scientists. This screenshot shows the browser running on a NeXT computer in 1993

 Going global
	`(Slide - Subtopic name)`
On 30th April 1993, CERN made the source code of WorldWideWeb available on a royalty-free basis, making it free software. By late 1993 there were over 500 known web servers. Initiated by Robert Cailliau, the First International World Wide Web conference was held at CERN in May. It was attended by 380 users and developers, and was hailed as the “Woodstock of the Web”.    
`(Slide - with First International World Wide Web conference)`  
 Let's talk about history of HTML  
	`(Slide - Subtopic name)`    
	Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser  
	`(Slide - what is HTML)`  
	HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not published officially, it was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0.   
	`(Slide - creator HTML)`    
	Versions
	`(Slide - Subtopic name)`
	The first version HTML 1.0 but was not published official, because until 1995, there were many unofficial HTML standards. To make the standard version different from them, it was immediately assigned a second number.  
	`(Slide - HTML 1.0)`  
HTML 2.0 was published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with several additional features; which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and improved various basic HTML functions, such as  
- Form-based file upload   
- Tables   
- Client-side image maps 
  
`(Slide - HTML 2.0)`  
HTML version 3 was proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in March 1995 and provided many new features, such as  
- Tags for creating tables  
- Markup mathematical formulas  
- Text wrapping around images  
  
The next version of HTML standart - HTML 3.2. Version 3.1 was never officially published, and the next version of the HTML standard was 3.2. Version 3.2 omitted many of the innovations of version 3.0, but added non-standard elements supported by the Netscape Navigator and Mosaic browsers.  
`(Slides - HTML 3.2)`    
Next version - version 4.0. It was published in December 1997. Version 4.0 pretty much cleaned up elements from previous versions. Many tags were marked as old and not recommended for use. The new version included support for frames, scripts, a general procedure for implementing various objects. Also, tables and forms were improved in it.HTML 4 was developed with the help of internationalization experts, making it possible to write documents in any language and easily transfer them around the world.    
`(Slides - HTML 4.0)`    
Next version HTML -HTML 4.01. Was published in December 1999. What new in this version, it:  
- Correct object/shapes/images  
- Fix bugs previos version  
  
`(Slides - HTML 4.01)`  
And finally version of HTML standart - HTML 5. HTML 5 was published in October 2014.  
- The new version made the syntax more strict than previous.  
- Improved multimedia technology support.  
- New structural elements appeared.  
- Excluded some obsolete tags.  
- More attention has been paid to supporting scripts like javascript.  
  
`(Slide - HTML 5)`  
Ok, it's the end of the history of HTML. Next, I tell about history of CSS.
`(Slide - Subtopic name)`
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language  
`(Slide - CSS)`  
Thanks for Håkon Wium Lie was created CSS in 1996.  
`(Slide - creator CSS)`  
Specification  
`(Slide - Subtopic name)`  
The first specification of CSS - CSS 1. CSS 1 was published in December 1996. And includes next features:  
- Font properties  
- Color for different element  
- Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of text  
- Alignment for different element  
- Margin, border, padding, and positioning for elements  
  
`(Slide - CSS 1)`    
The next specification of CSS - CSS 2. CSS 2 was published in May 1998. This specification was based on CSS1 with backward compatibility with a few exceptions. This specification include next features:
- Block layout. Relative, absolute and fixed positioning has appeared.  
- Media Types. Allows you to set different styles for different media.  
- Sound style sheets. Detects voice, volume, etc. for sound media.  
- Page carriers. Allows, for example, to set different styles for elements on even and odd pages when printing.  
- Advanced selector mechanism.  
- Generated content. Allows you to add content that is not in the source document, before or after the desired item. 
  
`(Slide - CSS 2)`  
The next specification CSS 3. The earliest version CSS 3 were published in June 1999.
Unlike previous versions, the specification is divided into modules, the development of which is independent. CSS3 is based on CSS2.1, complements existing properties and values, and adds new ones. The main feature of CSS3 is the ability to create animated elements without using JS , support for linear and radial gradients, shadows, smoothing, and more.    
`(Slide - CSS 3)`   
That all what I want to tell about history of WWW/HTML/CSS. Thanks for watching.
